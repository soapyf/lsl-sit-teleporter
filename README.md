# slurl based sit teleporter
Scripted sit teleporter with notecard configured teleport locations.
Supports single or multiple locations.

Locations are configured using "SLurls" entered into a notecard which is placed into the contents of a scripted object.


## Setup
1. Rez or place an object in the location you want it to be once setup is completed.
2. Place the script inside the object.
3. Create a notecard containing the slurl locations you want to use as teleport locations.
    Included is an example notecard setup for the region "No Mans Land".
    
4. Once you create and save the notecard place it inside the object you created. It will be loaded automatically.





The script will report in local chat how many locations were loaded or any errors

Once setup is completed avatars simply need to click the object and it will transport them to a random spawn from the list you created

It is recommended you create multiple objects if you expect your region/parcel to be busy as only one avatar can use the teleporter at a time
